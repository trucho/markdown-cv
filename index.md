## Research experience
`2014 - Present`
__Postdoctoral Fellow - Unit of Retinal Neurohysiology (Dr. Wei Li)__

__Research fellow - Laboratory of Dr. Enrico Nasi and Dr, Maria Gómez__
- *Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA*  
Development of genetic knock down in photoreceptors from scallop (Pecten irradians) through electroporation of short interference RNA

`2006 (Aug - Dec)`
__Research fellow - Laboratory of Dr. Enrico Nasi and Dr, Maria Gómez__
- *Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA*  
Tested the possibility of physiological reversal of the dopamine transporter for transmitter release in rat midbrain neurons.
Developed a novel technique to improve the sensitivity of amperometric detection through phase-locked detection

`2005 - 2006`
__Medical intern - Laboratory of Dr. Alejandro Múnera__
- *Department of physiological science, School of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia*  
Explored the effects of stress in the extinction and reacquisition in a spatial memory task

__Medical intern - Hospital San Rafael__
- *Fusagasugá, Cundinamarca, Colombia*  
Clinical internship in a rural hospital with hands-on experience on patient care, and including rotations through the different hospital services (emergency room, general surgery and orthopedics, pediatrics, internal medicine, gynecology and obstetrics).

## Teaching experience
`2017`
__Faculty - Citizen Science__

`2015`
__Faculty - Neurobiology summer course__
- *Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA*  
Partnered with Dr. Jon Sack to teach and train students on the theoretical principles of electrophysiology and the practical aspects of single-channel recordings, leading to the development of a short research project.

`2011`
__Research and teaching assistant - Neurobiology summer course__
